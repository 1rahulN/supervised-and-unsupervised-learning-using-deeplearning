Supervised Learning: Uses labeled data to train a model to make predictions or decisions. It requires input-output pairs and aims to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs. Unsupervised Learning: Uses unlabeled data to find hidden patterns or structures. It aims to explore the data's underlying structure without predefined labels.
